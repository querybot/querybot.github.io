Will see how start up parameters in blue prism. Start up parameters will use to transfer data from one page to another page or Process to object..

Description: we will create two pages in object studio.

Create one data item in page 1.

Create start up property in Page2Â  Start stage.

Next we will call second page in page1 using page stage. Where ever we call the page2 , we should pass value for the start up property, because we have created page2 with start up property. We will pass page1 data item to the page 2 start up property.

So, after running the process the data will transfer to the second page through property in start up parameters.

For more details .... please watch the below video..
