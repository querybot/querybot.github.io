Hi Folks, Welcome back, this is second post related to Code stage in BluePrism object studio. In this Session will see how to create a program to find whether given number is prime number or not. If given number is prime number our VBO will return "<strong>true</strong>", if not will return "<strong>false</strong>". It will take number as input and flag as output. Created a code stage and added required logic to compute prime number logic. See full implementation in the blow given video. Keep watching for more sessions.
